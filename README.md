# FootballManager in Java | 2022
Implemented a CRUD Angular application in Java using Spring that manages football teams and can also assign players to matches and teams and filter entities on various criteria.
# Photo Editor in Python - Design Patterns Showcase | 2022
Developed an application in python that can surf the internet and download images that the user requests but also let's the user edit and modify the photos ny applying filters and drawing on them. The design patterns used in this project are: Creational - Singleton; Structural - Decorato, Facade; Behavioural - Strategy, Command.
# Resaerch Project - Is the evolution of search algorithms finished? | 2021
The main purpose of this paper is to emphasize on the idea that search algorithms are always on the verge of evolution. In this paper we will be using Amazon’s OpenSearch and Elasticsearch services. To showcase one of the most powerful search engines we are using a small dataset of 10.000 (dataset created by myself using a python script that can generate random homogeneous data) elements and executing some test queries. The tests will be applied to distinct implementations and versions of the Elasticsearch principle with the goal of presenting the way this algorithm becomes more efficient with time.
# Programming Language Scanner and Parser in Java | 2021
Created a Scanner (lexical analyzer) and Parser (LR0 parser) in Java that can perform on a mini-programming language and can recursively built a parse tree as output. 
# Toy Language Interpreter in Java | 2020
Implemented a multi-threaded toy language interpreter in Java using layered architecture (MVC) and which has a GUI built using SceneBuilder. Through this project I was able to understand better the process required to implement an interpreter for a new programming language as well as how interpreters and compilers work.
# Entity manager – Object Oriented Programming Project | 2020
Developed a Qt GUI application in C++ that allows CRUD type operations to be made on a victim storing system. The application allows storing data into different type of files and has a GUI window with Undo/Redo buttons implemented using an Observer Pattern.
# Hangman | 2019
Implemented a Hangman game in Python using layered architecture (MVC) where the sentences can be chosen randomly from a file that can be dynamically modified.
# Obstruction | 2019
Implemented an Obstruction game in Python using layered architecture (MVC) where the user plays against the computer. Through this project I learned the importance of testing and validations in a project.
# Mini-Games | 2018
This project represents my first interaction with C# as well as a GUI. I implemented two simple games: “Simon Says” and “Catch Apples” and it helped me understand the basics of C#, but also how important a good GUI structure can be to a project.
